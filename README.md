# City Explorer

**Author**: Andrew Curtis
**Version**: 2.0.0

## Overview

This project involved building a stand-alone back end that interacts with a static front end that was provided for me to integrate my back-end app with. The app calls several third-party APIs, modifies the data as needed, and sends the data to the client to be displayed in the browser. Data persistence is managed with a PostgreSQL database.

## Getting Started

The site is deployed on Heroku, so a user must have an internet connection, visit the deployed front end of the City Explorer app (https://codefellows.github.io/city_explorer/), and enter into the form the URL of the deployed back end (https://city-explorer-for-lab-08.herokuapp.com).

## Architecture

For this project I used the following technologies: 

* **Languages:** JavaScript, SQL
* **Libraries and frameworks:** Node.js, Express, 
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Deployment platform:** Heroku
* **APIs:** Google Geocoding, Dark Sky (weather), Meetups, The Movie Database, The Hiking Project, and Yelp Fusion
